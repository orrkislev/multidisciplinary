TASK:
Given a theme: "${data.theme}"
Provide helpful context in Hebrew about who studies this and where to learn more.

- 2-3 general learning directions (courses, communities, experiences)

TONE:
- Encouraging and practical
- Hebrew throughout
- Avoid overwhelming with too many options
- Focus on accessible entry points
